# recursiveMapper

As workflows become more and more complex, the file structure also becomes more complex. This `mapper.sh` script is created to help map an entire folder and its sub-folder(s).

## Usage

`file[] dir1 <Ext;exec="mapper.sh",root="dir1">;`

Only change the dir1 to the folder to be mapped.
